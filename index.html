    <h2>What is Rugby?</h2>
    
    <p>Rugby is a high-energy ball game that combines strength, speed, and strategy.
    Played with an oval-shaped ball, it is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world.
    The game has two main versions: Rugby Union and Rugby League.</p>

 <h2>Where did Rugby come from?</h2>
 <p>Rugby’s history dates back to 1823 in England. Legend says a student named William Webb Ellis picked up the ball during a football match and ran with it.
This act led to the creation of a new sport. Today, rugby is played globally,
with major tournaments like the Rugby World Cup.</p>
