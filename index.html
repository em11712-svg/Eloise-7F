    <h1>Rugby</h1>
    <h2>What is Rugby?</h2>
    
    <p>Rugby is a high-energy ball game that combines strength, speed, and strategy. <br>
    Played with an oval-shaped ball, it is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world.<br>
    The game has two main versions: Rugby Union and Rugby League.</p>

 <h2>Where did Rugby come from?</h2>
 <p>Rugby’s history dates back to 1823 in England.<br>
Legend says a student named William Webb Ellis picked up the ball during a football match and ran with it.<br>
This act led to the creation of a new sport. Today, rugby is played globally,<br>
with major tournaments like the Rugby World Cup.</p>

<h2>Basic rules of Rugby</h2>
 <p>Rugby has simple but strict rules. The objective is to score more points than the opponent. Points can be earned through tries, conversions, penalties, and drop goals.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Scoring in Rugby</b><br>
Try (5 points): Scored by grounding the ball in the opponent’s in-goal area.<br>
Conversion (2 points): A kick after a try, taken in line with where the try was scored.<br>
Penalty Kick (3 points): Awarded after certain fouls.<br>
Drop Goal (3 points): Scored by kicking the ball through the goalposts during open play.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Passing and Tackling</b><br>
Players can only pass the ball backward or sideways.<br>
Forward passes result in a scrum for the opposing team. Tackling is allowed but must be below the shoulders.<br>
Dangerous tackles lead to penalties or suspensions.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Set Pieces: Scrums and Lineouts</b><br>
Scrum: Used to restart play after minor infringements. Eight forwards from each team bind together and push for the ball.<br>
Lineout: Occurs when the ball goes out of play. Players lift teammates to catch the thrown-in ball.
<br>
<b>4. Offside Rule</b><br>
Players must stay behind the ball carrier. Being in front of the ball without retreating is offside and results in a penalty.</p>
